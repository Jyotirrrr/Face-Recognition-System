# üë§ Face Recognition System

This project is a simple yet effective face recognition system built in Python. It uses the `face_recognition` library, which is a wrapper around dlib's powerful face recognition model, to identify and manipulate faces in images and real-time video streams.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Face Encoding**: Automatically encodes known faces from a set of labeled images.  
- **Image Recognition**: Recognizes faces in a static image file, drawing a bounding box and displaying the person's name.  
- **Real-time Webcam Recognition**: Performs live face recognition using a webcam feed.  
- **Persistence**: Saves face encodings to a file (`encodings.pickle`) so you don't have to re-encode faces every time you run the script.
